Description: Functions to calculate Conley Standard Errors. This package is 
  essentially a repackaging of work done by 
  \href{Darin Christiansen}{https://darinchristensen.com/} and 
  \href{Theimo Fetzer}{http://www.trfetzer.com/}, which is itself based on work
  by Solomon Hsiang, with an error caught by 
  \href{Jordan Adamson}{https://sites.google.com/view/jordan-adamson}. 
  Christensen and Fetzer's 
  \href{github repo}{https://github.com/darinchristensen/conley-se} is the 
  original source for this package.
